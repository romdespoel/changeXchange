"Most tourists don't have cash on arrival and can face upto 25% loss in value at local exchanges."


Problem Statement:
How might we design a service to reduce the uncertainty of tourists, cashless, upon arrival?

Goals:
- Easing travel
- No home-sickness
- Financial security
- Cheap exchange
- Peer-to-peer
- Low/No fees

Issues:
"May not have local exchange available on site of arrival."
"Allways an insecurity when arriving somewhere new."
"Feeling unsafe due to unfamiliar environment."
"Uneasy feeling of being lost cashless."
"Holding onto leftover, now unusable cash is cumbersome."
"Can cause a fear of travel, panic situation etc."
